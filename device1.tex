  \caption{Schematic of the light path through our microscope. Laser
    light enters from the lower left, is scrambled and homogenized to
    illuminate the full MMA and LCoS. $F$ is the field plane in the
    sample and its primed versions are conjugated planes. $P$ is the
    pupil of the objective. $B_0$ and $B_1$ are adjustable circular
    apertures. PBS is a polarizing beam splitter. DBS is a dichromatic
    beam splitter.}

     lengths. The focal length $f_\textrm{TL}$ of the tube lens can be
     varied. This allows to scale the second intermediate image
     $r''_\textrm{MMA}$ of the micro mirror array to fit the back
     focal plane of different objectives. Dimensions in mm.}
