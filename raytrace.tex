\chapter{Raytracing for spatio-angular microscopy}
\label{sec:raytrace}
\renewcommand{\i}{\nvect i}
\begin{summary}
  Imaging with our microscope requires that during the observation of
  the sample new light patterns are created continuously and as fast
  as possible. We can not solve this problem by using a commercial
  software and I therefore decided to implement a simple raytracer.

  This chapter documents the basic concepts. Note that some
  approximations, which are usually used in optical design (paraxial,
  only non-skew rays) are not applicable here, because rays are to be
  pursued through diverse fluorophore distributions in samples.

  The design parameters of our microscope objectives are not usually
  known to us. I therefore represent the high-aperture lens using a
  simplified model \citep{Hwang2008}. Together with a model of the
  fluorophore distribution in the sample I can to determine which
  regions of the objectives back focal plane are safe to illuminate
  and which will excite out-of-focus fluorescence.

  Further, I consider the refraction at the coverslip--medium
  interface for non-index matched media. This enables the calculation
  of illumination patterns for highly inclined and laminated optical
  sheet microscopy, as introduced in section \ref{sec:hilo}.

  {\bf Note:} The formulas in frames are implemented in the computer
  code that is published on
  \url{https://github.com/plops/mma/tree/master/lens}.
\end{summary}
\section{Refraction at planar surface}
I begin by describing refraction at a planar surface\footnote{I use
  the same notation as \cite{McClain1993}.}. The wavelength of the
light in vacuum defines the length of the wave vector $\k_0$. The
lengths of the incident and transmitted wave vectors $\k_1$ and $\k_2$
are given by the refractive index in their respective half space:
\begin{align}
  k_0&=2\pi/\lambda\\
  k_1&=n_1 k_0\\
  k_2&=n_2 k_0.
\end{align}
I choose the normal $\n$ to be directed into the half-space of the
incident wave (see \figref{fig:refraction-plane}) and define the
transversal and normal component of the wave vectors:
\begin{align}
  \k_{1n}&=(\k_1\n)\n\\ 
  \k_{1t}&=\k_1 - \k_{1n}.
\end{align}
The two component vectors are orthogonal and during refraction the
transversal component of the wave vector is invariant:
\begin{align}
  k_2^2&=k_{2n}^2 + k_{2t}^2\\
  \k_{2t}&=\k_{1t}.
\end{align}
Using the two equations from above one can calculate the length of the
normal component of the transmitted wave vector $\k_2$:
\begin{align}
  k_2^2&=k_{2n}^2 + (\k_1 - \k_{1n})^2\\
  k_{2n}^2&=k_2^2-(\k_1-(\k_1\n)\n)^2\\
  &= k_2^2-(k_1^2-2(\k_1\n)^2+(\k_1\n)^2)\\
  &= k_2^2-k_1^2+(\k_1\n)^2.
\end{align}
Finally one can express the full transmitted wave vector $\k_2$ using
only known quantities:
\begin{align}
  \k_2&=\k_{1t}-\sqrt{k_2^2-k_1^2+(\k_1\n)^2}\n\\
  &=\k_1-(\k_1\n)\n-\sqrt{k_2^2-k_1^2+(\k_1\n)^2}\n.
\end{align}
I divide by $k_2$ with $\k_2/k_2=\t$ and $\k_1/k_2=\eta\,\i$ in order
to introduce unit direction vectors $\i$ and $\t$ for incident and
outgoing light. The relative index change across the interface is
$\eta=n_1/n_2$.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{refraction}
  \caption{Refraction at an interface transforms the incident wave
    vector $\k_1$ into the outgoing wave vector $\k_2$.}
  \label{fig:refraction-plane}
\end{figure}
\begin{align}
  \t&=\eta\i-\eta(\i\n)\n-\sqrt{1-\eta^2+\eta^2(\i\n)^2}\n\\
  &=\boxed{\eta\i-\left(\eta\i\n+\sqrt{1-\eta^2(1-(\i\n)^2)}\right)\n}
\end{align}
When the radical in the square root is negative a reflection occurs
instead (TIRF). Then the tangential component is invariant and normal
component inverts the sign:
 \begin{align}
   \k_2&=\k_{1t}-\k_{1n}\\
   &=\k_1 - 2\k_{1n}\\
   &=\k_1-2(\k_1\n)\n\\
   \t_\textrm{TIR}&=\boxed{\i-2(\i\n)\n}
 \end{align}
\section{Intersection of a ray and a plane}
Let a ray start at a point $\s$ with direction $\hd$.  A plane
(defined by a point $\c$ and the normal $\n$) intersects this ray if
normal and ray direction are not perpendicular: $\n\,\hd\not=0$. The
distance between the plane and the origin is $h=\c\n$. I define the
plane equation in Hesse normal form:
\begin{align}
  \r\n=h
\end{align}
I replace the coordinate $\r$ with the ray equation and solve for
the parameter $\tau$:
\begin{align}
  (\s+\tau\hd)\n&=h\\
  \s\n+\tau\hd\n&=h\\
  \tau&=\boxed{\frac{h-\s\n}{\hd\n}}
\end{align}
 \begin{figure}[!hbt]
   \centering
   \svginput{1}{plane-intersection}
   \caption{Schematic of plane-ray intersection.}
 \end{figure}
\section{Intersection of a ray and a sphere}
Let a ray start at a point $\s$ with direction $\hd$.  Let a sphere be
centred in $\c$ with radius $R$. Their two equations
\begin{align}
  (\r-\c)^2&=R^2\\
  \r&=\s+\tau\hd
\end{align}
define the intersection points. Substitution of $\r$ results in a
quadratic equation for $\tau$:
\begin{align}
  (\s+\tau\hd-\c)^2&=R^2\\
  \l&:=\boxed{\s-\c}\\
  l^2+2\tau\l\hd+\tau^2-R^2&=0\\
  \underbrace{1}_a\tau^2+\underbrace{2\l\hd}_b\tau+\underbrace{l^2-R^2}_c&=0
\end{align}
\subsection{Solving the quadratic equation}
In order to prevent numerical errors the following solution should be
used \citep{Press1997}:
\begin{align}
  \Delta&:=\boxed{b^2-4ac}\\
  q&:=\boxed{-\frac{b+\sqrt{\Delta}\sign b}{2}}\\
  \tau&=\boxed{
  \begin{cases}
    q/a &\,\textrm{when}\,\abs{q}\approx 0\\ 
    c/q &\,\textrm{when}\,\abs{a}\approx 0\\
    (q/a, c/q) &\,\textrm{else}
  \end{cases}}
\end{align}
If the discriminant $\Delta$ is negative the ray misses the sphere and
there is no solution. If the discriminant is zero the ray touches the
periphery and there is only one solution. A positive discriminant
corresponds to two solutions.
\section{Refraction on paraxial thin lens}
The incident beam with direction $\i$ hits the lens at the point
$\vrho$. A line parallel to $\i$ through the centre of the lens
defines the point on the focal plane, which will be intersected by the
transmitted ray $\r$ as well.


\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{lens-fwd}
  \caption{Construction of a ray on a thin lens. The incident beam
    with direction $\i$ (from right) hits the lens at the point
    $\vrho$.}
\end{figure}


The triangle $ABC$ is similar to triangle $FOA$. All three angles are
identical because each of the lines are parallel:
$\overline{CB} \parallel \overline{OA} \parallel \vrho$,
$\overline{FA} \parallel \overline{CA}$ and $\overline{AB} \parallel
\overline{OF} \parallel \i$. The side $\overline{OF}$ is hypotenuse of
a right angled triangle. Its adjacent with respect to the angle
$\theta$ has length $f$. Therefore one can deduce the length
$\abs{\overline{OF}}=f/\cos\theta$.



Between the two similar triangles, the following relation holds and
can be used to calculate the length $\abs{\overline{BC}}$:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\abs{\overline{BC}}}{\abs{\overline{BA}}}&=
  \frac{\abs{\overline{OA}}}{\abs{\overline{OF}}}\\
  \frac{\abs{\overline{CB}}}{1}&=
  \frac{\rho}{f/\cos(\theta)}.
\end{align}
Given its length, the vector $\overline{CB}$ can now be calculated,
because its direction is known to be along $\vrho$. With this vector
and $\i$ one can now obtain the (arbitrarily scaled) transmitted
vector $\r'$. I could normalize it but it turns out to be useful for
the high NA immersion lens to find the vector $\r$, that ends in the
focal plane.  The procedure from above is condensed in the following
equations:
\begin{align}
  \vrho&=(x_0,y_0,0)^T=\rho (\cos\phi,\sin\phi,0)^T\\
  \phi&=\arctan(y_0/x_0)\\
  \cos\theta&=\boxed{\i\hz}\\
  \r'&=\i- \frac{\cos\theta}{f}\vrho\\
  \r&=\boxed{\frac{f}{\cos\theta} \i -\vrho}
\end{align}

\section{Refraction through high NA objective (illumination)}
It is possible to augment the results of the calculation from the
previous chapter to treat an aplanatic immersion objective
\citep{Hwang2008}.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{obj-fwd}
  \caption{Construction of a ray on an high numerical aperture oil
    immersion objective. As opposed to a thin air lens the objective's
    focal length needs to be corrected by the focus difference vector
    $\a$ to accommodate for the immersion and one must take into
    account spherical principal surface (aplanatic surface) .}
\end{figure}


I account for the immersion medium by shifting the focal plane in
sample space to $nf$ using the focus difference vector $\a$.
\begin{align}
  \a &= \boxed{f (n-1) \hz} \\
  R &= \boxed{nf}
\end{align}
The principal surface\footnote{Microscope objectives generally fulfil
  the Abbe sine condition and form stigmatic images from the sample
  plane in the image image plane. In this case the principal surface
  on the object side is a sphere.} is a sphere of radius $R=nf$ around
the image point \citetext{\citealt[p.~22]{Smith2000} and
  \citealt{Botcherby2008}}. In the paper \citet{Hwang2008} they
express the deviation between the real principal surface and the
principal plane with an approximation for small angles $\theta$ and
$\phi$:
\begin{align}
  \s &= \left(R - \sqrt{R^2-\rho^2}\right)\i
\end{align}
This is an approximation because it only takes into account the
perpendicular (along $\z$) distance between plane and sphere. They
demonstrate the viability of this approximation by comparing its
results with a full raytrace through a $100\times\,1.41$
objective. Focus displacement errors are less than \unit[130]{nm} for
a field of $\unit[86.4]{\mu m}$ radius. This would be sufficient for
our problem. However, in my implementation I reuse the code for
ray--sphere intersection to determine the exact vector $\s$.

The final ray exiting the objective has the direction $\r_0$:
\begin{align}
  \r_0 &= \boxed{\r + \a - \s}.
\end{align}
\section{Reverse path through oil objective (detection)}
Now I consider the oil objective in the reverse direction (see
\figref{fig:obj-ref-full}). Given a ray that starts within the sample
I will determine the ray in the pupil.

\subsection{Easy case: back focal plane positions only}
If the intersections of rays in the back focal plane are sufficient, a
full raytrace is not necessary. This is the case when imaging beads in
index matched embedding medium and we want to calculate a pattern for
the pupil plane SLM (MMA). Instead it is sufficient to ignore ray
origins and just consider their directions in the sample.

A unit ray direction $\i=(x,y,z)^T$ in sample space is transformed
into a position $\r_b=(x',y')^T$ in the back focal plane of the
objective. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ isn't changed when going through
the objective. The polar angle $\theta$ defines how far off axis the
back focal plane is hit.
\begin{align}
  \phi'&=\phi=\arctan(y/x)\\
  \theta&=\arcsin(\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2})\\
  r_b&=nf\sin\theta\\
  \r_b&=r_b(\cos\phi',\sin\phi')^T
\end{align}
 \begin{figure}[!hbt]
   \centering
   \svginput{1}{obj-rev}
   \caption{Schematic for tracing a ray direction $\i$ from sample
     space into the back focal plane. The bigger the angle between
     $\i$ and the optical axis, the further outside the ray will pass
     through the back focal plane.}
 \end{figure}
 \subsection{Full raytrace through oil objective in detection
   direction}
\label{sec:objective-raytrace-detection}
Now I discuss the general case and calulate both, the origins and the
directions of rays emerging from the back focal plane. This is
necessary in order to trace light bundles from the specimen into the
plane of the camera (or focal plane SLM). In the next section I will
further modify these formulas to incorporate aberrations due to
non-index matched embedding medium.

The position of the objective is defined by its principal point $\c$
and the normal $\n$ (directed along optical axis towards sample
space). The incident ray is defined by its starting point $\p$ and the
direction $\i$. First I calculate the centre of the aplanatic sphere
$\vect g$:
\begin{align}
  \vect g &= \c + nf \n.
\end{align}
Then I obtain the position $\p'$ by intersecting the incident ray and
the plane perpendicular to the optical axis through $\vect{g}$.  The
focus difference vector is defined by its length and the optical
axis. It can be used to calculate an intermediate point $\p''$.
\begin{align}
  \a &= -f(n-1)\n \\
  \p'' &= \p' + a.
\end{align}
The point $\p''$ has now been shifted, so that a thin air lens would
image it exactly as the oil objective would image $\p'$. One can use
$\p''$ to find the direction $\t$ of the transmitted ray. It is just
the normalized difference vector $\vect m$ to the principal point.
\begin{align}
  \vect m &= \c - \p'' \\
  \t &= \vect m / \abs{\vect m}.
\end{align}
As a last step I calculate the starting point $\e$ of the transmitted
ray by intersecting the incident ray with the aplanatic sphere.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{obj-rev-full}
  \caption{Construction to find the transmitted ray through an oil
    immersion objective from a point within the sample.}
  \label{fig:obj-ref-full}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Treatment of aberration (detection)}
\label{sec:ray-aberration}
Now I will extend the formulas of the previous section to include
aberrations due to a non-matched embedding medium $n_e\not=n$.

I consider a ray originating in point $\p$ with direction $\i$ within
an immersion of index $n_e$. I determine the intersection $\f$ of the
ray with the coverslip--embedding interface and refract to obtain
$\i'$. Then I calculate the time $t$ a photon takes, to travel from
$\p$ to the interface $\f$:
\begin{align}
  t = \abs{\f - \p} \frac{n_e}{c}
\end{align}
and extend the path of the photon backward along the direction $\i'$
(corrected for the refraction at the coverslip--embedding surface) by
the distance $tc/n$. This results in the corrected position $\p'$ that
indicates where the photon would have originated if the embedding
would have been index matched.  Now I can apply the equations from
the previous sections on the ray defined by $\p'$ and $\i'$ to obtain
the transmitted ray in the pupil.

 \begin{figure}[!hbt]
   \centering
   \svginput{1}{obj-rev-full-emb}
   \caption{Construction that treats the interface between embedding
     and immersion medium}
 \end{figure}
\section{Sphere projection}
\label{sec:sphere-projection}
When I model our sample as a collection of spheres, it is useful to
trace rays from the periphery of these spheres through an in focus
target $\c$ into the back focal plane. 

While the previous sections have described a fairly general raytracer,
this section is very technical and relates to our specific problem to
represent the sphere model of a fluorophore distribution with as few
rays as possible.

The tangents of an out-of-focus sphere $S^\s_r$ centred at $\s$ with
radius $r$ that pass through the target $\c$ form a double cone
(assuming $\c$ is outside of $S^\s_r$. The tangents touch the surface
of the sphere $S^\s_r$ at the circular intersection $C$ with the sphere
$S^\c_R$ centred at $\c$ with radius $R=\abs{\c-\s}$. Radius $R$ is
the distance from the target to the centre of the out-of-focus sphere.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{touch-cone}
  \caption{Schematic of how an out-of-focus nucleus and a target point
    $c$ (not necessarily in the centre of a target nucleus) define a
    cone of tangential rays.}
\end{figure}
In order to find a point $\e$ where a tangent touches the out-of-focus
sphere, it is sufficient to solve the following equation in a 2D
coordinate system with the origin in the centre $\s$ of the
out-of-focus sphere:
\begin{align}
  (x-R)^2+y^2&=R^2\\
  x^2+y^2=r^2
\end{align}
There are two solutions:
\begin{align}
  x_1&=\frac{r^2}{2R}\label{eqn:x1}\\ 
  y_{1/2}&=\pm\frac{r}{2R}\sqrt{4R^2-r^2} \label{eqn:y1}
\end{align}
In the case $R<r$ the out-of-focus nucleus is intersecting the target,
obviating the reason to do the projection in the first place.

I construct two vectors $\hx$ and $\hy$ that span the coordinate
system, in order to transform the solution from 2D into 3D. The
(unnormalized) direction $\x$ of the x-axis of this coordinate system
is given by the difference vector of the target $\c$ and the nucleus
centre $\s$. The direction $\y$ must be perpendicular to $\x$ and is
obtained by calculating the cross product with another vector $\q$.
I ensure that $\q$ and $\x$ are not colinear. The vectors $\q$ and
$\x$ are colinear, when the absolute value of their scalar product
equals the square of the length $\abs{\q\x}=\x^2$.
\begin{align}
  \x&=\c-\s\\
  \q&=\begin{cases}
    (0,0,1)^T & \textrm{when}\ \abs{x_z}<\frac{2}{3}\abs{\x}\\
    (0,1,0)^T & \textrm{else}
  \end{cases}\\
  \y&=\x\times\q \\
  \hx&=\x/\abs{\x}\\
  \hy&=\y/\abs{\y}
\end{align}
Now I can sample the intersection circle $C$ in order to create
viable starting points $\e$ for tangential rays.  Let $R_\phi^\hc$ be
a rotation matrix that rotates a vector by angle $\phi$ around an axis
$\hc$. A point $\e$ on the circle is then defined using one solution
from equations \ref{eqn:x1} and \ref{eqn:y1}. The ray direction $\f$
is then easily obtained:
\begin{align}
  \e&=\s+x_1\hx+y_1R_\phi^\hx\hy\\
  \f&=\c-\e.
\end{align}
Tracing a sufficient number of rays (e.g.\ 16) with direction $\f$ for
different angles $\phi$ to the back focal plane gives the projection
of the intersection circle $C$. Note that this projection in general
is not a circle anymore.

For practical reasons its useful to project vector $\x$ as well. It
can be used as the centre of the (distorted) shape on the back focal
plane to rasterize it as a fan of triangles.

\section{Conclusion}
I documented how to trace rays through a perfect thin lens and a high
numerical aperture objective. These equations are the starting point
to find good illumination strategies. 

The treatment of aberrations due to a non-matching embedding medium
needs more parameters (target depth, refractive index $n_e$) and a
raytrace from sample space, through the back focal plane, tubelens and
focal plane SLM (fLCoS). However, it enriches the type of control,
that can be implemented. Illumination with high angles into a low
index embedding medium will create thin slices of light (highly
inclined and laminated optical sheet, see section \ref{sec:hilo}).

Note that ray optics are not an sufficient approximation, when
intensity features in the scale of the wavelength are to be
investigated. Small features would mean that only a few pixels of the
LCoS would be enabled. This would mean that most of the information of
the MMA pattern is filtered out at the LCoS and no simultaneous tight
angular control would be possible.
