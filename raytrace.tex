\chapter{Raytracing for spatio-angular microscopy}
\label{sec:raytrace}
\renewcommand{\i}{\nvect i}
\begin{summary}
  Imaging with the microscope we developed requires a continuous
  update of the patterns for the spatial light modulators during
  operation. It is not easily possible to solve the problem with
  commercial software. Therefore, a simple raytracer is implemented in
  this work.

  This chapter documents the basic concepts. Some approximations,
  which are usually used in optical design (paraxial, only non-skew
  rays) are not applicable here, because rays are to be pursued in all
  possible angles through diverse fluorophore distributions in the
  specimen.

  I begin by introducing simple geometric formulas to determine the
  points of intersection between a ray and a plane or a sphere. I also
  describe how to calculate refraction at a planar surface.

  Then I explain the refraction at a thin, paraxial lens and show a
  modification of the formulas for high aperture lenses. This allows
  to trace rays through a microscope objective in two directions
  (denoted as detection or illumination direction) without knowing the
  exact design parameters and glass types.

  Furthermore, I consider the refraction at the ``cover slip--medium''
  interface for non-index matched media. This enables the calculation
  of illumination patterns for highly inclined and laminated optical
  sheet microscopy, as introduced in section \ref{sec:hilo}.

  I follow up with a rather technical discussion of a geometric
  problem that helps to significantly speed up the raytracing
  calculations for the specific case of a sample that can be
  represented as a three-dimensional distribution of fluorescent
  spheres.

  {\bf Note:} The formulas that are emphasized by surrounding frames
  are implemented in the computer code that is published on
  \url{https://github.com/plops/mma/tree/master/lens}.

\section{Basic geometric algorithms}
\subsection{Intersection of a ray and a plane}
 \begin{figure}[!hbt]
   \centering
   \svginput{1}{plane-intersection}
   \caption{Schematic of plane-ray intersection.}
\end{figure}
Let a ray start at a point $\s$ with direction $\hd$.  A plane
(defined by a point $\c$ and the unit normal $\n$) intersects this ray if
its normal and the ray's direction are not perpendicular:
$\n\,\hd\not=0$. The distance between the plane and the origin is
$h=\c\,\n$. The equation of the plane is given in Hesse normal form:
\begin{align}
  \r\n=h
\end{align}
I replace the coordinate $\r$ with the ray equation and solve for the
parameter $\tau$.
\begin{align}
  (\s+\tau\,\hd)\,\n&=h\\
  \s\n+\tau\,\hd\,\n&=h\\
  \tau&=\boxed{\frac{h-\s\,\n}{\hd\,\n}}
\end{align}
The point of intersection is located on the ray at $\s+\tau\,\hd$.
\subsection{Intersection of a ray and a sphere}
Let a ray start at a point $\s$ with direction $\hd$.  Let a sphere be
centred in $\c$ with radius $R$. There are two equations
\begin{align}
  (\r-\c)^2&=R^2\\
  \r&=\s+\tau\hd
\end{align}
that define the intersection points. By substituting $\r$ one obtains
a quadratic equation in the distance $\tau$ along the ray:
\begin{align}
  (\s+\tau\hd-\c)^2&=R^2\\
  \l&:=\boxed{\s-\c}\\
  l^2+2\tau\l\hd+\tau^2-R^2&=0\\
  \underbrace{1}_a\tau^2+\underbrace{2\l\hd}_b\tau+\underbrace{l^2-R^2}_c&=0
\end{align}
%\subsubsection{Solving the quadratic equation to obtain the ray--sphere intersection}
In order to prevent numerical errors the following solution should be
used \citep{Press1997}:
\begin{align}
  \Delta&:=\boxed{b^2-4ac}\\
  q&:=\boxed{-\frac{b+\sqrt{\Delta}\sign b}{2}}\\
  \tau&=\boxed{
  \begin{cases}
    q/a &\,\textrm{when}\,\abs{q}\approx 0\\ 
    c/q &\,\textrm{when}\,\abs{a}\approx 0\\
    (q/a, c/q) &\,\textrm{else}
  \end{cases}}
\end{align}
If the discriminant $\Delta$ is negative the ray misses the sphere and
there is no solution. If the discriminant is zero the ray touches the
periphery of the sphere and there is only one solution. A positive discriminant
corresponds to two solutions.
\subsection{Refraction at planar surface}
Now I describe the refraction at a planar surface\footnote{I use the
  same notation as \cite{McClain1993}.}. The wavelength of the light
in vacuum defines the length of the wave vector $\k_0$. The lengths of
the incident and transmitted wave vectors $\k_1$ and $\k_2$ are
obtained by multiplication with the refractive index in their
respective half space:
\begin{align}
  k_0&=2\pi/\lambda\\
  k_1&=n_1 k_0\\
  k_2&=n_2 k_0.
\end{align}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{refraction}
  \caption{Refraction at an interface transforms the incident wave
    vector $\k_1$ into the outgoing wave vector $\k_2$.}
  \label{fig:refraction-plane}
\end{figure}
I choose the normal $\n$ to be directed into the half-space of the
incident wave (see \figref{fig:refraction-plane}) and define the
transversal and normal component of the wave vectors to be:
\begin{align}
  \k_{1n}&=(\k_1\n)\n\\ 
  \k_{1t}&=\k_1 - \k_{1n}.
\end{align}
These two vectors are orthogonal and during refraction the transversal
component of the wave vector is invariant:
\begin{align}
  k_2^2&=k_{2n}^2 + k_{2t}^2\\
  \k_{2t}&=\k_{1t}.
\end{align}
Using the two equations from above, one can calculate the length of
the normal component of the transmitted wave vector $\k_2$:
\begin{align}
  k_2^2&=k_{2n}^2 + (\k_1 - \k_{1n})^2\\
  k_{2n}^2&=k_2^2-(\k_1-(\k_1\,\n)\,\n)^2\\
  &= k_2^2-(k_1^2-2(\k_1\,\n)^2+(\k_1\,\n)^2)\\
  &= k_2^2-k_1^2+(\k_1\,\n)^2.
\end{align}
Finally, one can express the full transmitted wave vector $\k_2$ using
only known quantities:
\begin{align}
  \k_2&=\k_{1t}-\sqrt{k_2^2-k_1^2+(\k_1\,\n)^2}\n\\
  &=\k_1-(\k_1\n)\n-\sqrt{k_2^2-k_1^2+(\k_1\,\n)^2}\n. \label{eq:k2}
\end{align}
I divide by $k_2$ with $\k_2/k_2=\t$ and $\k_1/k_2=\eta\,\i$ in order
to introduce unit direction vectors $\i$ and $\t$ for incident and
outgoing light. The relative index change across the interface is
$\eta=n_1/n_2$. With these substitutions equation (\ref{eq:k2}) becomes:
\begin{align}
  \t&=\eta\,\i-\eta\,(\i\,\n)\,\n-\sqrt{1-\eta^2+\eta^2\,(\i\,\n)^2}\,\n\\
  &=\boxed{\eta\,\i-\left(\eta\,\i\,\n+\sqrt{1-\eta^2(1-(\i\,\n)^2)}\right)\n}
\end{align}
When the expression under the square root is negative a reflection
occurs instead  of refraction. Note that in my application total internal
reflection (TIRF) just corresponds to a loss of the beam, because the reflected beam no longer
contributes to sample illumination. The exact direction of this
 beam is not relevant in this case but I give the equation here for
completeness' sake.

In the case of reflection, the tangential component is invariant and
the normal component inverts sign:
 \begin{align}
   \k_2&=\k_{1t}-\k_{1n}\\
   &=\k_1 - 2\k_{1n}\\
   &=\k_1-2(\k_1\,\n)\,\n\\
   \t_\textrm{TIR}&=\boxed{\i-2(\i\,\n)\n}
 \end{align}
\section{Refraction through lenses}
An \cma{validity of thin lens model} ideal lens is infinitesimally
thin and is completely defined by its focal length. For an ideal lens the focal
length is independent of the incidence angle but in practice, the
model of the thin lens is only valid for lenses of long focal length and
for paraxial rays that subtend very small angles from the optical
axis.

For a better approximation of refraction through a \cma{principal planes} thick lens
the two principal planes of
the thick lens are calculated and the ray is shifted between them axially
\citep{Smith2000}. The principal plane of a thick lens is located on
the intersection between an incident beam $\i$, that is parallel to
the optical axis, and the transmitted beam $\r$. Just as the focal
length, the principal planes are a property of lenses that are only
defined in the paraxial limit. There are always two principal planes,
one for each of the two possible illumination directions. The
distances between each principal plane and its corresponding focus
point (the intersection of $\r$ with the optical axis) are identical,
and define the focal length.

As already mentioned in section \ref{aplanatic} on page
\pageref{aplanatic} a microscope objective is a lens which is
corrected to have a constant focal length for rays of widely varying
incidence angle. In this case, the principle surface is no longer a
plane but is deformed into a spherical surface. After introducing the
formulas for the thin lens in the next section, I show in section
\ref{sec:high-aperture-lens} how to carry over those formulas to a
model that describes an aplanatic lens with immersion.

\subsection{Refraction through a paraxial thin lens}
First I describe the refraction by a thin lens: The incident beam with
direction $\i$ hits the lens at the point $\vrho$. A line parallel to
$\i$ through the centre $O$ of the lens defines the point on the focal
plane, which will be intersected by the transmitted ray $\r$ as well.


\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{lens-fwd}
  \caption{Construction of a ray that is refracted through a thin
    lens. The incident beam with direction $\i$ (from right) hits the
    lens at the point $\vrho$. This diagram is inspired from a figure
    in \cite{Hwang2008}.}
\end{figure}


The red triangle~1 with the points $ABC$ is similar to green
triangle~2 with points $FOA$. All three angles are identical because
each of the lines are parallel: $\overline{CB} \parallel
\overline{OA} \parallel \vrho$, $\overline{FA} \parallel
\overline{CA}$ and $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{OF} \parallel
\i$. The side $\overline{OF}$ is hypotenuse of the yellow right angled
triangle 3. Its adjacent with respect to the angle $\theta$ has length
$f$. Therefore one can deduce the length
$\abs{\overline{OF}}=f/\cos\theta$.



Between the two similar triangles, the following relation 
can be used to calculate the length $\abs{\overline{BC}}$:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\abs{\overline{BC}}}{\abs{\overline{BA}}}&=
  \frac{\abs{\overline{OA}}}{\abs{\overline{OF}}}\\
  \frac{\abs{\overline{CB}}}{1}&=
  \frac{\rho}{f/\cos(\theta)}.
\end{align}
Given its length, the vector $\vv{CB}$ is now calculated by its length
and the direction $\vrho$. With this vector and $\i$ one can now
obtain the (arbitrarily scaled) transmitted vector $\r'$.  Only the
two framed equations need to be implemented to calculate refraction on
a thin lens with the procedure from above:
\begin{align}
  \vrho&=(x_0,y_0,0)^T=\rho (\cos\phi,\sin\phi,0)^T\\
  \phi&=\arctan(y_0/x_0)\\
  \cos\theta&=\boxed{\i\,\hz}\\
  \r'&=\i- \frac{\cos\theta}{f}\vrho\\
  \r&=\boxed{\frac{f}{\cos\theta} \i -\vrho}
\end{align}
with the axial unit vector $\hz=(0,0,1)^T$.
\subsection{Refraction through high aperture objective (illumination)}
\label{sec:high-aperture-lens}
Now I modify the results of the calculation from the previous section
to treat an aplanatic immersion objective \citep{Hwang2008}.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{obj-fwd}
  \caption{Ray construction for a high numerical aperture objective
    with immersion. As opposed to a thin air lens the objective's
    focal length needs to be corrected by the focus difference vector
    $\a$ to accommodate for the immersion and one must take into
    account spherical principal surface (aplanatic surface).}
\end{figure}
I account for the immersion medium by axially shifting the focal plane
in sample space to $nf$ using the difference vector $\a$, i.e.\ in an
immersion medium with $n=1.52$ the focus moves further away from the
principal plane.
\begin{align}
  \a &= \boxed{f (n-1) \hz} \\
  R &= \boxed{nf}
\end{align}
In order to account for the curvature of the aplanatic surface, the
origin of the transmitted ray is axially shifted by a $\rho-$dependent
sag $\s$ from the principal plane onto the aplanatic surface:
\begin{align}
  \s &= \left(R - \sqrt{R^2-\rho^2}\right) \hz
\end{align}
The final ray exiting the objective has the direction $\r_0$:
\begin{align}
  \r_0 &= \boxed{\r + \a - \s}.
\end{align}

All microscope lenses that come into consideration for use in the
system that we built are designed as an aplanatic lens. The model
described by above formulas is therefore very well suited to represent
the objectives when we run our illumination optimization algorithm to
find illumination patterns for the two SLM in our spatio-angular
microscope.

In the paper \citet{Hwang2008} the authors demonstrate the viability
of this model by comparing its results with a full raytrace through a
$100\times$ objective with $NA=1.4$. There, focus displacement errors
are less than \unit[130]{nm} for a field of $\unit[86.4]{\mu m}$
radius. This is perfectly adequate for our application.

One might think it would be better to know the exact objective
parameters, i.e.\ glasses, curvatures and vertex positions of lens
surfaces. These details are, however, to my knowledge not published by
any manufacturer. In addition alignment of the components plays a
prominent role in building high performance objectives. Therefore just
the design parameters alone probably do not provide a better model of
a microscope objective. They would have to be augmented with
performance measurements of the individual objective,
e.g. point-spread functions in different regions of the field.

\subsection{Reverse path through oil objective (detection)}
Now I consider an oil immersion objective in the detection direction,
tracing rays from the sample into the pupil.

For that I present two approaches. The first and simpler one utilizes
the fact that a perfect microscope lens converts ray angle in the
sample in a linear manner into positions on the pupil. This approach
is sufficient when calculating pupil plane SLM patterns for samples in
an index matched embedding medium.

In the second approach I additionally calculate the angle in which
rays emerge from the pupil. For a perfectly aplanatic lens this would
hardly be an advantage but the formulas will be modified to take into
account aberrations.
\subsubsection{Easy case: back focal plane positions only}
If the points of ray intersection of the back focal plane are
sufficient, a full raytrace is not necessary. This is the case with
aberration-free imaging, i.e.\ when the sample is embedded in an index
matched medium and we want to calculate a pattern for the pupil plane
SLM. Then it is possible to ignore the starting points of rays in the
specimen and just work with their directions.

A unit ray direction $\i=(x,y,z)^T$ in sample space is transformed
into a position $\r_b=(x',y')^T$ in the back focal plane of the
objective. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ isn't changed when going through
the objective. The polar angle $\theta$ defines how far off axis the
back focal plane is hit.
\begin{align}
  \phi'&=\phi=\arctan(y/x)\\
  \theta&=\arcsin(\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2})\\
  \r_b&=r_b\,(\cos\phi',\sin\phi')^T,\quad\textrm{with}\   r_b=nf\sin\theta
\end{align}
 \begin{figure}[!hbt]
   \centering
   \svginput{1}{obj-rev}
   \caption{Schematic for tracing a ray direction $\i$ from sample
     space into the back focal plane. The bigger the angle between
     $\i$ and the optical axis, the further outside the ray will pass
     through the back focal plane.}
 \end{figure}
 \subsubsection{Full raytrace through oil objective in detection
   direction}
\label{sec:objective-raytrace-detection}
Now I discuss the general case and calculate both the origin and the
direction of a ray emerging from the back focal plane. This is
necessary in order to trace light bundles from the specimen into the
plane of the camera (or focal plane SLM). In the next section I will
further modify these formulas to incorporate aberrations due to
non-index matched embedding medium.

The position of the objective is defined by its principal point $\c$
and the normal $\n$ (directed along optical axis towards sample
space). The incident ray is defined by its starting point $\p$ and the
direction $\i$. First I calculate the centre of the aplanatic sphere
$\vect g$ (see \figref{fig:obj-rev-full}).
\begin{align}
  \vect g &= \c + nf\, \n.
\end{align}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{obj-rev-full}
  \caption{Construction to find the transmitted ray through an oil
    immersion objective from a point within the sample.}
  \label{fig:obj-rev-full}
\end{figure}
Then I obtain the position $\p'$ by intersecting the incident ray and
the plane perpendicular to the optical axis through the centre
$\vect{g}$ of the aplanatic sphere.  The focus difference vector $\a$ is
defined by its length and the optical axis. It can be used to
calculate an intermediate point $\p''$.
\begin{align}
  \a &= -f\, (n-1)\,\n \\
  \p'' &= \p' + a.
\end{align}
The point $\p''$ has been shifted, so that an aplanatic air lens would
image it exactly as the oil objective would image $\p'$. One can use
$\p''$ to find the direction $\t$ of the transmitted ray. It is just
the normalized difference vector $\vect m$ to the principal point $\c$.
\begin{align}
  \vect m &= \c - \p'' \\
  \t &= \vect m / \abs{\vect m}.
\end{align}
As a last step I calculate the starting point $\e'$ of the transmitted
ray by intersecting the incident ray with the aplanatic sphere (in
point $\e$) and axially shifting this point onto the principal plane.

Note: In order to verify the correctness of these formulas or their
implementation it is possible to compare the algorithms of this
section (for tracing in detection direction) and section
\ref{sec:high-aperture-lens} (for illumination direction).
\subsection{Treatment of aberration (detection)}
\label{sec:ray-aberration}
Now I will extend the formulas of the previous section to include
aberrations due to a non-matched embedding medium $n_e\not=n$.

I consider a ray originating in point $\p$ with direction $\i$ within
an embedding medium of index $n_e$. I determine the intersection $\f$
of the ray with the ``cover slip--embedding'' interface and refract to
obtain $\i'$. Then I calculate the time $t$ a photon takes, to travel
from $\p$ to the interface $\f$:
\begin{align}
  t = \abs{\f - \p} \frac{n_e}{c}
\end{align}
and extend the path of the photon backward along the direction $\i'$
(corrected for the refraction at the ``cover slip--embedding'' surface) by
the distance $tc/n$. This results in the corrected position $\p'$ that
indicates where the photon would have originated if the embedding
medium were index matched.  Now I can apply the equations from the
previous section on the ray defined by $\p'$ and $\i'$ to obtain the
transmitted ray in the pupil.

 \begin{figure}[!hbt]

   \caption{Construction of an oil immersion objective with a
     non-index matched embedding medium.}
 \end{figure}
\section{Sphere projection}
\label{sec:sphere-projection}
While the previous sections have described a fairly general raytracer,
this section is very technical and relates to the specific problem to
represent a fluorophore distribution as a model of spheres and
simulate it with as few rays as possible.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \svginput{.95}{touch-cone}
  \caption{{\bf (A,B,E)} Diagrams depicting the geometry of a sample
    of spherical nuclei. The main text derives the rays on the cone
    through the target point $\c$ that touches an out-of-focus nucleus
    in the curve $C$. {\bf (C)} Map of the pupil plane. A ray is sent
    from each point of the pupil plane into the target point $\c$. The
    brightness value in the pupil map indicates the length of the
    segment of the ray that intersects out-of-focus nuclei. {\bf (D)}
    Approximation of the map in (B) using the technique discussed in
    this section with a minimum number of rays per out-of-focus
    nucleus. }
  \label{fig:touch-cone}
\end{figure}


\figref{fig:touch-cone}~A) shows two rays emanating from the pupil
plane and illuminating the target point $\c$. For
\figref{fig:touch-cone}~C) rays were traced from each point of the
pupil plane through the target point $\c$. The brightness of the map
in \figref{fig:touch-cone}~C) indicates the length of ray segments for
rays that intersect with out-of-focus rays.

Creating such an image in the illumination direction requires to trace
a lot of rays (at least $50\times 50$). In order to reduce the
computational effort, I reverse the calculation direction and trace
rays starting from the periphery of out-of-focus nuclei through the
target point $\c$ in order to determine appropriate ``shadow masks''
in the pupil plane (as depicted in
\figref{fig:touch-cone}~D)). Already with six rays per nucleus, this
approach can determine very good masks.

Now I explain how to select good points on the periphery of
out-of-focus nuclei in order to allow this calculation. I utilize the
geometry in \figref{fig:touch-cone}~E).


The tangents of an out-of-focus sphere
{\color[rgb]{0.06666667,0.50196078,0}$S^\s_r$} centred at $\s$ with
radius $r$ that pass through the target $\c$ form a double cone
(assuming $\c$ is outside of $S^\s_r$). The tangents touch the surface
of the sphere $S^\s_r$ in the circle
{\color[rgb]{0.66666667,0,0}{$C$}}. We will find a parametric
expression for the points on the circle $C$ by intersecting the sphere
$S^\s_r$ and the sphere {\color[rgb]{0.28235294,0.24313725,0.21568627}$S^\c_R$}
centred at $\c$ with radius $R=\abs{\c-\s}$ which is the distance from
the target to the centre of the out-of-focus sphere.

In order to find a point $\e$ where a tangent touches the out-of-focus
sphere, it is sufficient to solve the following equation in a
two-dimensional coordinate system with the origin in the centre $\s$
of the out-of-focus sphere:
\begin{align}
  (x-R)^2+y^2&=R^2\\
  x^2+y^2=r^2
\end{align}
There are two solutions:
\begin{align}
  x_1&=\frac{r^2}{2R}\label{eqn:x1}\\ 
  y_{1/2}&=\pm\frac{r}{2R}\sqrt{4R^2-r^2} \label{eqn:y1}
\end{align}
In the case $R\le r$ the out-of-focus nucleus is very close to the
target, obviating the reason to do the projection in the first
place. In the more useful case of $R>r$ there are two solutions but
either one of them is sufficient to define the circle $C$.

I construct two normalized vectors $\hx$ and $\hy$ that span the
coordinate system, in order to transform the solution from 2D into
3D. The direction of $\hx$ is given by the difference vector between
target $\c$ and nucleus centre $\s$. The direction $\hy$ must be
perpendicular to $\x$ and I ensure this by calculating the cross
product of $\x$ with an arbitrary vector $\vzeta$.  The only
constraint on the vector $\vzeta$ is that it must not be colinear with
$\x$. Therefore I choose $\vzeta$ to be a vector along the $z-$axis,
except when $x$ comes close to the $z-$axis. Then I choose $\vzeta$ to
be along the $y-$axis.
\begin{align}
  \x&=\c-\s\\
  \y&=\x\times\vzeta \quad \textrm{with}\ \vzeta=\begin{cases}
    (0,0,1)^T & \textrm{when}\ \abs{x_z}<\frac{2}{3}\abs{\x}\\
    (0,1,0)^T & \textrm{else}
  \end{cases}\\
  \hx&=\x/\abs{\x}, \quad \hy=\y/\abs{\y}
\end{align}
Now I can sample the intersection circle $C$ in order to create
viable starting points $\e$ for tangential rays.  Let $M_\phi^\hc$ be
a rotation matrix that rotates a vector by angle $\phi$ around an axis
$\hc$. A point $\e$ on the circle is then defined using one solution
from equations (\ref{eqn:x1}) and (\ref{eqn:y1}). The ray direction $\f$
is then easily obtained:
\begin{align}
  \e(\phi)&=\s+x_1\hx+y_1M_\phi^\hx\,\hy\\
  \f(\phi)&=\c-\e.
\end{align}
Tracing a sufficient number of rays (e.g.\ 7) with direction $\f$ for
different angles $\phi$ to the back focal plane gives the projection
of the intersection circle $C$. Note that this projection in general
is not a circle anymore.

For practical reasons I project the vector $\hx$ as well. I use it as
a centre to rasterize the shape in the pupil plane as a fan of
triangles.

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter I have given an overview on the raytracer that I use
as a component in the illumination optimization algorithm for the
spatio-angular microscope. This software is tailored to the problem of
imaging with an aplanatic lens. I optimized the calculations so that
illumination patterns can be determined in real time, while the device
operates.

I described an algorithm that can account for aberration that occurs
when a sample is not embedded in index matched medium. On the one hand
this has a negative impact on the resolution of the detected images
already for small penetration depths ($\sim\unit[10]{\mu}$) but it
enables the interesting approach of highly inclined and laminated
optical sheet microscopy (see section \ref{sec:hilo}). In this case, a
window on the edge of the pupil is illuminated so that rays approach
the ``cover slip--medium'' surface close to the critical angle of total
reflection --- and after refraction they will traverse the medium in a
very steep angle. To illuminate the proper position in the field, the
window that is displayed on the focal plane SLM must be moved in order
to compensate for any, but mainly spherical, aberrations.

Note that ray optics are not a sufficient approximation, when
intensity features in the scale of the wavelength are to be
investigated. Small features would mean that only a few pixels of the
focal plane SLM would be enabled. This would mean that information of
the pupil plane SLM pattern is heavily filtered and no simultaneous
tight angular control would be possible. Therefore, algorithms that
are based on code in this chapter must generate patterns with big
feature sizes. Features on the pupil plane SLM should be larger than
several percent of the pupil diameter.
