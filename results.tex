\section{Measuring acceptance angle for three different embedding
  media}
As one of the first attempts to use the spatio-angular illumination
system, I devised an experiment to determine the acceptance angle of a
microscope objective as a function of the embedding medium.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \svginput{1}{tirf-exp}
  \caption{A fluorescent plane on a slide is embedded in oil, water or
    air. The thickness of the embedding medium is approximately
    $\unit[5]{\mu m}$. The focal plane SLM illuminates a disk with $\unit[30]{\mu
      m}$ diameter while a  window of $15\times 15$ pixels is scanned over the
    MMA. The window corresponds to a square with $\unit[210]{\mu m}$
    on the side as opposed to \unit[3.6]{mm} BFP diameter. 
% 200 px diameter on LCoS
% 15x15 px full diameter is D=2*(R=f*NA) f=164.5/63=2.61  NA=1.38
% D=3.6mm -> D/256*15 = 210 um

  \label{fig:tirf-exp}
\end{figure}



For the measurement a thin layer of fluorophores was applied with a
marker pen on three microscope slides. Furthermore, as a spacer, a
surrounding circle was painted with nail polish. After drying a drop
of immersion oil ($n=1.52$) or water ($n=1.33$) was added to two
samples. Then coverslips were added to all samples and sealed with
nail polish.

During the measurement the focal plane SLM projected a disk with
$\unit[30]{\mu m}$ diameter on the fluorescent plane. The illumination
angle was varied by stepping a window of $15\times 15$ pixels
(equivalent to 1/17th of the pupil diameter) over the pupil plane SLM.

For each angle, the sum of all the light on the camera is
recorded. The data is depicted in the three images in
\figref{fig:tirf-exp}.  These images contain a bright disk whose
diameter is growing with the index of the embedding medium. The center
of the disk corresponds to the optical axis of the
objective. Therefore pupil plane SLM is not exactly aligned with the
optical axis.  Points in the interior of the circle have an almost
constant intensity (residual fluctuations can be attributed to
non-uniformity of the illumination of the pupil plane SLM). For oil
immersion the diameter of the disk corresponds to the diameter of the
pupil.

If the index of the embedding medium is less than the index of the
immersion medium, then total internal reflection occurs on the
interface between coverslip and embedding medium for high incidence
angles. The excitation light can then no longer reach the
sample. Therefore, the disks in the plots for water and air are smaller.

\section{Measuring light distribution by bleaching a fluorescent gel}
The above-described experiment allows only an indirect measure of then
effects of angular control in our microscope. Now I describe an
experiment where fluorophores are bleached in a several 10 microns
thick layer. This allows a more direct measurement of the light
distribution in the sample by imaging the bleached region in a
confocal microscope. 

As a sample we use a 4\% agarose gel containing fluorescently labeled
DNS plasmids. The exact sequence of the plasmids is irrelevant. They
only serve as carriers for the fluorophore (SYBR Save DNA gel stain,
Invitrogen). These samples are stable for several weeks and no
unbleached fluorophores return to bleached regions. The gel was chosen
and prepared by Florian R\"uckerl \citep{Ruckerl} with whom I
conducted this experiment.

During the experiment the focal plane SLM displays three different
patterns (all dark, all bright, bright vertical bar) and the pupil
plane SLM displays eight different patterns (all dark, all bright, and
6 circular windows). The focal plane SLM was projected as far into the
middle of the gel layer as the working distance of the objective
allowed and an exposure series was mad overnight. Utilizing a
XY-stage, the sample was moved by \unit[0.4]{mm} between exposures.

The laser delivers a continuous beam of \unit[473]{nm} wavelength with
\unit[400]{mW} power. It is modulated using an acousto-optic modulator
(AOM) so that only during the camera integration time (\unit[20]{ms})
and when the two SLM are in a defined state light can excite the
sample. The modulated beam has an average power of \unit[15]{mW}. For
this experiment I illuminate the rotating micro-lens array and
integrator rod directly (without fibre bundle). I made this decision
in the hope to reduce the necessary bleaching time. In hindsight it
would have been better to use the fibre bundle. Behind the integrator
tunnel there were still \unit[7]{mW} average power and in front of the
dichroic mirror of the microscope a mere \unit[17]{uW} (with both SLM
showing a white pattern).

    by Florian R\"uckerl (Institut Pasteur).}
  \label{fig:overview-bleach}
\end{figure}

\figref{fig:overview-bleach}~a) is a mosaic of confocal images in the
vicinity of the plane in the bleached gel where the focal plane SLM
was focused. The bleached areas form a pattern of $11\times 6$
exposures. The bleaching dose varies with the vertical direction as
indicated by the accumulated exposure times (consisting of numerous
\unit[20]{ms} exposures). Along the horizontal direction, different
SLM patterns were displayed. The two areas at both outer borders were
bleached with full angular and spatial exposure. The next column gives
an indication of how well both SLM can produce black as no bleaching
pattern is evident in these places.

The central areas were all displaying a vertical bar on the focal
plane SLM while the pupil plane SLM displayed a circular window,
varying the incidence angle. The first bar from the left was
illuminated with all angles. \figref{fig:overview-bleach}~b) shows a
three-dimensional representation of a confocal recording of the
bleached area. Unfortunately, three separate bundles are visible,
indicating insufficient uniformity of the illumination.

The images in \figref{fig:overview-bleach}~c) and d) show confocal
measurements of illumination with restricted angles. For this, a
circular window with radius $r=0.3$ was displayed on the pupil plane
SLM. Where the coordinates $\rho$ and $r$ are given relative to the
pupil radius --- for $\rho=1$ the window would be centered on the
periphery of the pupil, as indicated in the drawing
\figref{fig:overview-bleach}~e).
