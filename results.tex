\section{Measuring acceptance angle for three different embedding
  media}
As one of the first attempts to use the spatio-angular illumination
system, I devised an experiment to determine the acceptance angle of a
microscope objective as a function of the embedding medium.

    $\unit[5]{\mu m}$. The focal plane SLM illuminates a disk with
    $\unit[30]{\mu m}$ diameter while a window of $15\times 15$ pixels
    is scanned over the MMA. The window corresponds to a square with
    $\unit[210]{\mu m}$ on the side as opposed to \unit[3.6]{mm} BFP
    diameter.  The red numbers indicate the diameter of the bright
    circle in pixels of the pupil plane SLM.

For the measurement a thin layer of fluorophores was applied with a
marker pen on three microscope slides. Furthermore, as a spacer, a
surrounding circle was painted with nail polish. After drying a drop
of immersion oil ($n=1.52$) or water ($n=1.33$) was added to two
samples. Then coverslips were added to all samples and sealed with
nail polish.

During \cma{scan pupil plane SLM} the measurement the focal plane SLM
projected a disk with $\unit[30]{\mu m}$ diameter on the fluorescent
plane. The illumination angle was varied by stepping a window of
$15\times 15$ pixels (equivalent to 1/17th of the pupil diameter) over
the pupil plane SLM.

For each angle, the sum of all the light on the camera is
recorded. The data is depicted in the three images in
\figref{fig:tirf-exp}.  These images contain a bright disk whose
diameter $d_\textrm{crit}$ is growing with the index of the embedding
medium. The center of the disk corresponds to the optical axis of the
objective. Therefore pupil plane SLM is not exactly aligned with the
optical axis.  Points in the interior of the circle have an almost
constant intensity (residual fluctuations can be attributed to
non-uniformity of the illumination of the pupil plane SLM). For oil
immersion the diameter of the disk corresponds to the diameter of the
pupil.

If the index of the embedding medium is less than the index of the
immersion medium, then total internal reflection occurs on the
interface between coverslip and embedding medium for high incidence
angles. The excitation light can then no longer reach the
sample. Therefore, the disks in the plots for water and air are
smaller.

Zwischen dem Durchmesser des hellen Kreises $d_\textrm{crit}$ und dem
kritischen Winkel der Totalreflexion an der Grenzflaeche vom coverslip
$n_\textrm{cs}=n_\textrm{oil}=1.52$ zum embedding medium
$n_\textrm{emb}$ besteht folgender Zusammenhang:
\begin{align}
  \theta_\textrm{crit}&=\arcsin\left(\frac{n_\textrm{emb}}{n_{cs}}\right) \\
  d_\textrm{crit} &= 2 n_\textrm{imm} f_\textrm{obj}
  \sin\theta_\textrm{crit}= 2 n_\textrm{imm} f_\textrm{obj}
  \frac{n_\textrm{emb}}{n_{imm}}
\end{align}
Eine Vergleich der Verhaeltnisse der gemessenen Durchmesser mit dem
Verhaeltnis der Indizes in Tabelle 1 zeigt, dass die Messung gut mit
der Theorie uebereinstimmt.

\section{Measuring light distribution by bleaching a fluorescent gel}
The above-described experiment allows only an indirect measure of the
effects of angular control in our microscope. Now I describe an
experiment where fluorophores in a slab of several microns thickness
are bleached. This allows a more direct measurement of the light
distribution in the sample by imaging the bleached region in a
confocal microscope.

As a sample we use a 4\% agarose gel containing fluorescently labeled
DNS plasmids. The exact sequence of the plasmids is irrelevant. They
only serve as carriers for the fluorophore (SYBR Save DNA gel stain,
Invitrogen). These samples are stable for several weeks and no
unbleached fluorophores return to bleached regions. The gel was chosen
and prepared by Florian R\"uckerl with whom I conducted this
experiment. We reported on this in \cite{Ruckerl}.

During the experiment the focal plane SLM displays three different
patterns (all dark, all bright, bright vertical bar) and the pupil
plane SLM displays eight different patterns (all dark, all bright, and
6 circular windows). The focal plane SLM was projected as far into the
middle of the gel layer as the working distance of the objective
allowed and an exposure series was mad overnight. Utilizing a
XY-stage, the sample was moved by \unit[0.4]{mm} between exposures.

The \cma{overall light efficiency} laser delivers a continuous beam of
\unit[473]{nm} wavelength with \unit[400]{mW} power. It is modulated
using an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) so that only during the camera
integration time (\unit[20]{ms}) and when the two SLM are in a defined
state light can excite the sample. The modulated beam has an average
power of \unit[15]{mW}. For this experiment I illuminate the rotating
micro-lens array and integrator rod directly (without fibre bundle). I
made this decision in the hope to reduce the necessary bleaching
time. In hindsight it would have been better to use the fibre
bundle. Behind the integrator tunnel there were still \unit[7]{mW}
average power and in front of the dichroic mirror of the microscope a
mere $\unit[17]{\mu W}$ (with both SLM showing a white pattern, giving
an illuminated field diameter of $\unit[40]{\mu m}$).

\figref{fig:overview-bleach}~a) is a mosaic of confocal images in the
vicinity of the plane in the bleached gel where the focal plane SLM
was focused. The bleached areas form a pattern of $11\times 6$
exposures. The bleaching dose varies with the vertical direction as
indicated by the accumulated exposure times (consisting of numerous
\unit[20]{ms} exposures).  Strong in-focus bleaching becomes evident
for bleach durations from \unit[30]{s} and higher, corresponding to a
light dose above $\unit[40]{J/cm^2}$ in the focal plane.
%17e-6 W * 30s /	(pi (20e-6 m)^2)

Along the horizontal direction, different SLM patterns were
displayed. The two areas at both outer borders were bleached with full
angular and spatial exposure. The next column gives an indication of
how well both SLM can produce black as no bleaching pattern is evident
in these places.

The \cma{observed bleaching patterns1} central areas were all
displaying a vertical bar on the focal plane SLM while the pupil plane
SLM displayed a circular window, varying the incidence angle. The
first bar from the left was illuminated with all
angles. \figref{fig:overview-bleach}~b) shows a three-dimensional
representation of a confocal recording of the bleached
area. Unfortunately, three separate bundles are visible, indicating
insufficient uniformity of the illumination.  As the non-uniformities
are not rotationally symmetric with respect to the optical axis, the
bundles propagate at slightly different angles.

The images in \figref{fig:overview-bleach}~c) and d) show confocal
measurements of illumination with restricted angles. For this, a
circular window with radius $r=0.3$ was displayed on the pupil plane
SLM. Where the coordinates $\rho$ and $r$ are given relative to the
pupil radius --- for $\rho=1$ the window would be centered on the
periphery of the pupil, as indicated in the drawing
\figref{fig:overview-bleach}~e).

The bleached digits in the mosaic (framed by red circles) are
landmarks that were retrospectively bleached into the specimen for
orientation during the acquisition with the confocal microscope.

\section{Beads under spatio-angular illumination}
The next experiment models the imaging conditions of a biological
sample. For this, beads of three microns diameter were distributed in
agarose gel. The goal is to first localize the beads and subsequently
utilize the knowledge of their three-dimensional distribution to find
patterns for the pupil plane SLM to excite and image the beads
inidividually while avoiding exposure of out-of-focus beads.

First of all \cma{wide field baseline} I show a focal series of wide
field images with $z-$steps of one micron and illumination of the full
field using all angles in \figref{fig:m_wf}. These recordings show how
several beads sequentially come into focus. Unfortunately, the gel
contributes a relatively high background fluorescence from which the
blurred images of the out-of-focus beads are no longer distinguishable
after only a few microns. For this sample of sparse beads, their
three-dimensional distribution could easily be determined from these
wide field images. In a more dense sample, e.g. a higher bead
concentration or nuclei in an embryo, this is no longer possible.


\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{m_wf}
  \caption{Wide field stack of a three-dimensional distribution of
    yellow-green beads in agarose gel. Sampling in $z$ is
    $\unit[1]{\mu m}$.}
  \label{fig:m_wf}
\end{figure}

In those cases \cma{optical sectioning} it is useful to utilize
structured illumination to separate out-of-focus and in-focus
fluorescence. \figref{fig:m_sec} shows the computed optical sections
from four raw images per slice, which are displayed in
\figref{fig:m_phase} in the appendix on page \pageref{fig:m_phase}.
The sections in \figref{fig:m_sec} show relatively destinctive
vertical reconstruction artifacts. These can be avoided using the HiLo
reconstruction method which has the additional advantage of only
needing two raw images per slice.

However, \cma{bead localization} the HiLo method needs considerably
more code and I have not implemented it in my real-time imaging
software. Also, the artifacts have no effect on the localization
precision of the algorithm that I describe next: I determine the
center of each bead by finding local maxima after applying a
three-dimensional difference of Gaussian filter (matched to the bead
diameter). The result is depicted in \figref{fig:m_sec}. In order to
facilitate the discussion I manually added the bead numbers to the
optical sections.
