\chapter{The concept of spatio-angular microscopy}
\label{sec:concept}
\begin{summary}
  Here we introduce our spatio-angular illumination system. First we
  motivate the concept of simultaneous angular and spatial control at
  hand (FIXME anhand eines beispiels zeigen) of exemplary three
  dimensional fluorophore distributions.  

  Then we describe some decisions we faced during the initial design
  phase. We show (FIXME beleuchten) differences between our system and
  the light field microscope (\ref{levoy}) and argue advantages (FIXME
  and disadvantages) of our approach.

  Finally, we discuss a method of finding
